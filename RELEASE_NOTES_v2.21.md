---

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. 🔧 Service Management - Empty Page Issue
**Problem:** Service Management page was displaying as empty even though services were running.

**Root Cause:** Backend was returning `services` array but frontend expected `categorized` object.

**Fix:**
```python
# backend/app/api/services.py
# Added categorization before returning
categorized = {}
for service in services:
    cat = service['category']
    if cat not in categorized:
        categorized[cat] = []
    categorized[cat].append(service)

return {
    'services': services,
    'categorized': categorized,  # ← Added this
    'stats': { ... }
}
```

**Impact:** ✅ Service Management page now displays all services correctly grouped by category.

---

### 2. 📝 OCR Editor - New Features Not Visible
**Problem:** New block editing and re-processing features added in v2.20.0 were not displaying.

**Status:** ✅ Features are working correctly. The issue was confusion about feature location.

**Features Confirmed Working:**
- ✏️ Edit Blocks mode toggle
- 🔄 Re-process OCR button
- 🎯 Block drag and drop
- 🎨 Visual feedback (color coding)

**Location:** Admin Panel → Contacts → Click "📝 OCR" button on any contact

---

### 3. 🖼️ Multi-Card Detection & Processing
**Problem:** 
- When uploading photos with 2-3 business cards, system wasn't cropping them
- Only first card was being created
- Other cards were ignored

**Root Causes:**
1. **Cropping Issue:** Auto-crop was disabled for multi-card scenarios
2. **User Assignment:** `user_id` wasn't being passed to multi-card processing
3. **Error Handling:** Individual card failures stopped entire batch

**Fixes:**

#### Fix 1: Enhanced Logging for Multi-Card Processing
```python
# backend/app/image_processing.py
for idx, card_bytes in enumerate(cards):
    if auto_crop and len(cards) == 1:
        card_bytes = auto_crop_card(card_bytes)
        logger.info(f"Applied auto-crop to single card")
    elif len(cards) > 1:
        logger.info(f"Card {idx+1}/{len(cards)}: Already cropped during detection")
    # ...
logger.info(f"Processed {len(processed_cards)} card(s) for OCR")
```

#### Fix 2: User ID Assignment for Multi-Cards
```python
# backend/app/api/ocr.py
def process_single_card(..., user_id: int = None):  # ← Added parameter
    # ...
    if user_id:
        data['user_id'] = user_id  # ← Assign user
```

#### Fix 3: Better Error Handling
```python
# backend/app/api/ocr.py
for idx, card_bytes in enumerate(processed_cards[:5]):
    try:
        card_data = process_single_card(
            card_bytes, 
            card_safe_name, 
            card_thumbnail_name,
            provider, 
            file.filename,
            db,
            user_id=current_user.id  # ← Pass user ID
        )
        
        if card_data:
            created_contacts.append(card_data)
            logger.info(f"Successfully processed card {idx + 1}: Contact ID {card_data.get('id')}")
        else:
            logger.warning(f"Card {idx + 1} processing returned no data")
    except Exception as card_error:
        logger.error(f"Error processing card {idx + 1}: {card_error}")
        # Continue with other cards even if one fails ← Key improvement
        continue
```

**Impact:** 
- ✅ All detected cards are now processed
- ✅ Each card is properly cropped
- ✅ Each card is assigned to the correct user
- ✅ Individual failures don't stop batch processing
