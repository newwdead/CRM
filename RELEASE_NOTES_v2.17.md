## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Developers

**No breaking changes!** The refactoring is backward compatible.

**AdminPanel.js Changes:**
- Component still works the same way
- Internal structure changed (modular)
- Props unchanged: `{ t, lang }`
- All tabs functional

**If you imported AdminPanel:**
```javascript
// Still works the same:
import AdminPanel from './components/AdminPanel';

// Usage unchanged:
<AdminPanel lang={lang} />
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### ContactList.js
- **Size:** 1,008 lines
- **Status:** Working perfectly
- **Recommendation:** Keep as is (critical production component)
- **Alternative:** Incremental refactoring available if needed
- **Risk:** High (requires extensive testing)

### React Query Integration
- **Status:** Planned but not critical
- **Benefit:** Better data fetching and caching
- **Priority:** Low (current solution works well)
