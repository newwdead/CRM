**Status:** Production Ready ✅

---

## 🎯 Overview

This release focuses on significant user experience improvements in the contact list interface, fixes to the OCR editor, and critical GitHub Actions workflow fixes.

## ✨ New Features & Improvements

### 1. 📊 Optimized Contact List Table
**Problem:** Table was too wide, causing horizontal scrolling  
**Solution:**
- ✅ Fixed column widths for all table columns
- ✅ Text overflow with ellipsis (`...`) for long content
- ✅ Tooltips show full text on hover
- ✅ `table-layout: fixed` for consistent sizing
- ✅ Responsive design - no horizontal scroll

**Impact:** Much better UX, all data visible without scrolling

### 2. 🔧 Streamlined Contact Actions
**Problem:** Duplicate "Edit" button - confusing UX  
**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed standalone "Edit" button from actions column
- ✅ Click on any contact row to open full card view
- ✅ Kept OCR Editor button for quick OCR corrections
- ✅ Cleaner, more intuitive interface

**Impact:** Reduced clutter, clearer user flow

### 3. 💾 Fixed OCR Editor Save Functionality
**Problem:** Changes in OCR editor weren't reflected in contact list  
**Solution:**
- ✅ Contact list now automatically reloads after OCR save
- ✅ Editor closes after successful save
- ✅ Success/error notifications with proper error handling
- ✅ No duplicate toast messages

**Impact:** OCR corrections now immediately visible everywhere

**Problem:** `release.yml` had YAML syntax errors causing workflow failures

**Files Changed:**
