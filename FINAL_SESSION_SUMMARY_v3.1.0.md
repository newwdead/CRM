## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Repository Method Aliases ⭐
**Problem:** API endpoints used old method names  
**Solution:** Added alias methods for backward compatibility

**SettingsRepository:**
- `get_app_setting()` → `get_setting_by_key()`
- `create_app_setting()` → simplified creation
- `update_app_setting()` → simplified updates

**UserRepository:**
- `count()` → `count_users()`

**Impact:** Fixed 10+ API tests instantly!

---

### 2. Model Schema Alignment ⭐
**Problem:** Tests used incorrect field names  
**Solution:** Updated all tests to match actual models

**Fixed:**
- OCRCorrection: Added `original_box`, changed `field_name` → `corrected_field`
- AuditLog: Removed `entity_id`, added `contact_id`
- DuplicateContact: Changed `similarity` → `similarity_score`

**Impact:** Repository tests 100% passing!

---

### 3. Service Method Signatures ⭐
**Problem:** Service methods required user context  
**Solution:** Updated all tests to include `test_user` fixture

**Fixed:**
- `create_contact(data, user, auto_detect_duplicates=False)`
- `update_contact(id, data, user)`
- `delete_contact(id, user)`

**Impact:** Service tests 79% passing!

---

### 4. Return Type Handling ⭐
**Problem:** Methods changed return types  
**Solution:** Updated tests to handle new types

**Fixed:**
- `list_contacts()` returns dict (was tuple)
- `search_contacts()` returns List[Dict] (was List[Contact])
- `filter_by()` returns tuple of (list, count)

**Impact:** API tests working correctly!

---
