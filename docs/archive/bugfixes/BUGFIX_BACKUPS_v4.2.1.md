## Date: October 24, 2025

## 🚨 Issue #4 (Continued): Database Backups - Mixed Content Error

**Priority:** 🔴 Critical  
**Location:** https://ibbase.ru/admin → Database Backups  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 📋 Problem Description:

### Original Error:
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://ibbase.ru/admin' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://ibbase.ru/backups'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

### User-Facing Error:
```
Network error: Failed to connect to server
No backups found. Click "Create Backup Now" to create your first backup.
```

### Console Errors:
```javascript
admin:1 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://ibbase.ru/admin' was loaded over HTTPS, 
        but requested an insecure resource 'http://ibbase.ru/backups'.
logger.js:28 An error occurred. Check browser console in dev mode.
BackupManagement.js:37 error
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis:

### Issue 1: Trailing Slash
- **Frontend:** `/api/backups/` (with trailing slash)
- **Backend:** `/backups` (no trailing slash)
- **Result:** Endpoint mismatch

### Issue 2: Service Worker Caching
- Service Worker (v2.4.0) was caching old requests
- Cached requests had stale URLs
- Browser was serving cached HTTP responses

### Issue 3: Browser Cache
- Browser cache was serving old frontend bundle
- Old bundle had incorrect API calls
- Hard refresh was required to clear

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented:

### 1. Fixed API Endpoint URLs
**File:** `frontend/src/components/admin/BackupManagement.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed trailing slash: `/api/backups/` → `/api/backups`
- ✅ Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` header
- ✅ Added `Pragma: no-cache` header
- ✅ Added `cache: 'no-store'` to fetch options

**Before:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/backups/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`
  }
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/backups', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache'
  },
  cache: 'no-store'  // Disable caching
});
```

### 2. Updated Service Worker Version
**File:** `frontend/public/service-worker.js`

**Changes:**
- Version: `2.4.0` → `2.4.1`
- Cache name: `ibbase-v2.4.0` → `ibbase-v2.4.1`
- Runtime cache: `ibbase-runtime` → `ibbase-runtime-v2.4.1`

**Why:** Forces browser to download new Service Worker and clear old caches

### 3. Applied to All Backups Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/backups` - List backups
- ✅ `POST /api/backups/create` - Create backup
- ✅ `DELETE /api/backups/{filename}` - Delete backup

---

## 📦 Deployment:

**Commits:**
- `6060b83` - Fix: Backups endpoint - Remove trailing slash and disable cache
- `[commit]` - Bump Service Worker version to force cache refresh

**Files Changed:**
1. `frontend/src/components/admin/BackupManagement.js` (cache control added)
2. `frontend/public/service-worker.js` (version bumped)

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Git commit ✅
2. Git push to main ✅
3. Frontend rebuild (36 seconds) ✅
4. Frontend restart ✅
5. Service Worker updated ✅

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
**Option A: Hard Refresh**
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Option B: Unregister Service Worker**
1. Open https://ibbase.ru/admin
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to: Application → Service Workers
4. Click "Unregister" for ibbase Service Worker
5. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Step 2: Test Backups Tab
1. Open https://ibbase.ru/admin
2. Click "Database Backups" tab
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Should see: No Mixed Content errors ✅
5. Try "Create Backup Now" button

### Step 3: Expected Results
✅ No Mixed Content errors  
✅ No "Network error: Failed to connect" messages  
✅ Backups list loads (or shows "No backups found" if empty)  
✅ Create backup button works  
✅ HTTPS requests only (check Network tab)

## 🔧 Technical Details:

### Why Mixed Content Error Occurred:

1. **Service Worker Cache:**
   - Old Service Worker (v2.4.0) cached frontend bundle
   - Cached bundle had old API calls
   - Browser served cached version instead of new code

2. **Trailing Slash:**
   - `/api/backups/` doesn't match backend `/backups`
   - Nginx routing might have rewritten URL incorrectly
   - Could have caused redirect to HTTP

3. **Browser Aggressive Caching:**
   - React production builds are aggressively cached
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) required to bypass cache
   - Service Worker makes it even more aggressive

### Why Solution Works:

1. **Cache-Control Headers:**
   - `Cache-Control: no-cache` - Always validate with server
   - `Pragma: no-cache` - HTTP/1.0 compatibility
   - `cache: 'no-store'` - Don't store in cache at all

2. **Service Worker Version Bump:**
   - New version triggers SW update
   - Old caches are automatically cleared
   - Fresh code downloaded

3. **Trailing Slash Removed:**
   - `/api/backups` matches backend `/backups` after Nginx strips `/api/`
   - No unnecessary redirects
   - Cleaner routing
