## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From v2.1 to v2.2

**No breaking changes!** This is a backward-compatible release.

**Database Migration:**
```bash
# Tables will be created automatically on first startup
# SQLAlchemy will create:
# - tags table
# - groups table
# - audit_logs table
# - contact_tags association table
# - contact_groups association table

# Verify migration
docker exec -it bizcard-backend python -c "
from app.database import engine
from app.models import Base
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
print('All tables created successfully!')
"
```

**Dependency Installation:**
```bash
# Rebuild backend container to install reportlab
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

**No Data Loss:**
- Existing contacts remain unchanged
- New relationships are optional
- Audit logging starts from upgrade time
- Tags and groups are empty initially
