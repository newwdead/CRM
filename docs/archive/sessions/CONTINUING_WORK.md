## ‚è≥ Next Steps: Phases 2-3-4

### Option 1: AI Assistant Continues (Limited Time)
**Pros:** Fast initial progress  
**Cons:** May need multiple sessions  
**Estimated:** Can complete 2-3 hours of work per session

### Option 2: Manual Execution (Full Control)
**Pros:** Complete at your pace  
**Cons:** Requires time investment  
**Tools:** 
- COMPREHENSIVE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_v4.6.0.md (strategy)
- PHASE_2_3_4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md (detailed steps)
- MODERN_UI_MIGRATION.md (examples)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. AI does quick wins (2-3 hours)
2. You complete remaining work using guides
3. AI helps with specific issues
